# Choose Your Own Adventure

Dr Who Adventure Game. This is a choose your own adventure game in which you run the file adventure.rb on the command line. When prompted to make a choice, type in the number of the choice you make at the console prompt. (Btw the Dalek choice is kind of bare, aside from a very menacing picture of Dalek.)

In order for for the ascii art to work, you can type in 
brew install imagemagick
brew install xz
gem install asciiart

before running my program.
