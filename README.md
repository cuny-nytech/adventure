# Choose Your Own Adventure
This adventure is about a man who gets caught up in a series of unfortunate events when he takes a trip to see his beloved aunt. You will make choices based on what you would do by pressing 'a' or 'b' when prompted. If you choose any other letter, the question will repeat and you will have an opportunity to play the question again. Good luck. 

~There are two VERY different endings to this story, I hope you pick one the right one!
