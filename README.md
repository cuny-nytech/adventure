** Manoj Gurung's Choose Your Own Adventure Game! **

This is a simple Choose Your Own Adventure Game that I created to familiarzie myself with Ruby.

The story is about a student waking up for his first day of class. And based on the user's input, there are different ways that the story can end.

To run this program, simply clone this repository, and run the .rb file using Ruby.
        i.e. Ruby myAdventure.rb
